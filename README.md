# Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network that recognizes handwritten English digits using Tensorflow and Python

Python Version 3.7.7

To run the project, you must first install all the necessary libraries.
To do that:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test the Neural Network against the given sample images, you could run the testImage.py file
```
python testImage.py
```

To test the neural network by providing input, un-cooment the code in testImage.py and provide the path

Notes:
1. The image should only contain a single English digit (like 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
2. The image dimensions should be 28x28 pixels
